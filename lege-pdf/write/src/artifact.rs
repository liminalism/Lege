//! PdfPageArtifact: the page contract submitted by pipeline workers.
//! PdfImageElement, PdfImageResource (Jpeg/Jpx/Jbig2/CcittGroup4/Indexed8),
//! PreparedTextLayer, PreparedGlyphLayer, exact resident_bytes(). PLAN.md §4.2.
//!
//! This is the *entire* public input vocabulary. Every variant maps to one PDF
//! image dictionary shape (see `images.rs`). Adding a variant is a plan change,
//! not a drop-in — invalid combinations are made unrepresentable here.
//!
//! `PreparedGlyphLayer` is the visible-text counterpart of the invisible OCR
//! layer: glyph ids into the document-wide glyph font (`/F2`, see
//! `DocumentWriter::set_glyph_font`), positioned per line in PDF user space.
